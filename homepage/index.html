            Disclaimer: These puzzles are not intended to be easily solved! This is only for those who enjoy spending hours of their day digging towards the solution.<br/><br/>
            Even being able to make decent progress on only one puzzle shows an immense amount of skill in puzzle-solving.<br/><br/>
            And yes, our name is a direct reference to the 100 blue-eyes puzzle.<br/>
