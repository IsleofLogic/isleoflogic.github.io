  Hello!
About us: At Isle of Logic, we're dedicated to creating puzzles that push the boundaries of how difficult a puzzle can truly be. 
These puzzles are not intended to be easily solved! This is only for those who enjoy spending hours of their day digging towards the solution.
    Even being able to make decent progress on only one puzzle shows an immense amount of skill in puzzle-solving.
     And yes, our name is a direct reference to the 100 blue-eyes puzzle.
